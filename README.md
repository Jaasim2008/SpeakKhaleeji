# Speak Khaleeji
A small project because I'm learning khaleeji (emirati) arabic because I'm planning to go to univeristy in Oman (or any GCC country), yeah so I'm guessing that I would need to speak at least a bit of arabic to survive there. So, I thought of sharing my learning experience here and to help out you all!
